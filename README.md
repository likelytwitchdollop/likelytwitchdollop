<b>Hi, there 👋🏾.</b>

<p>My name is Cynthia (but people call me cynth). I'm a Full-Stack (JavaScript/TypeScript) Engingeer with next to 3 years of experience in the software industry, and a Human Experience Researcher. My interests range from human experience research, visual and motion design, to systems design and architecture, and cloud computing (yup, it's a lot).</p>
